<h3>About Avatar Corporation</h3>
<hr />
<p><em>At Avatar, corporate values are much more than a programme or a policy &#45; they define who we are 
and inform the decisions we make</em>. The company&#96;s guiding principle is the Golden Rule &#45; to treat 
others as you wish to be treated &#45; and as such, Avatar strives to have a long&#45;lasting, positive 
influence on the communities where we operate and on the people we employ and serve around the world. 
We believe that this goal is integral to our success as a company. This commitment is expressed 
consistently in our actions through three main areas of focus. By acting in a manner consistent with 
our corporate values, Avatar will continue to seek opportunities to enrich and contribute positively 
to the global community.</p>
<h3>The Little Things Matter</h3>
<hr />
<p>Like being welcomed by team members who greet the morning with exactly what you wanted but didn&#96;t 
need to ask: the morning paper, coffee and a warm hello. Or simply being able to open the door to 
the most comfortable room you&#96;ve seen in weeks and collapsing into a much&#45;needed catnap.</p>
<h3>Travel Is About Connecting</h3>
<hr />
<p>What families and individuals dream of &#45; being away from home without being apart, beds that make 
dreams better, being surrounded by people who share a sense of adventure &#45; is what we strive for 
with every detail.<br />
